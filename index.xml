Our graph is defined as G={V,E}, where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges.
In more intuitive words: you start from some point on a graph and expand outward one level at a time. The first level is simply one node, and the next levels are simply all the nodes near a node in the previous level (see the colorful graph on the cover of this post).</description></item><item><title>The Channel</title><link>https://redblacktech.com/posts/channel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 17:29:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://redblacktech.com/posts/channel/</guid><description>We have a YouTube channel! The idea behind the channel is to analyze video games through the lens of computer science, as well as to provide intuitive explanations for apparently difficult topics.
When we say computer science, we mean it! we have covered everything from using object oriented design for FIFA&amp;rsquo;s virtual ref to mini-lectures on big data architecture.
