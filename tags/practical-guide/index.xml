Simple as that.
Strangely, even though DevOps is a major buzzword in tech, many online struggle to provide a useful definition for DevOps. Take a look at Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s definition:
&amp;ldquo;DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers&amp;rdquo;
That is not a precise enough definition to be useful. There are so many things that definition applies to, a lot of them totally unrelated to tech (think about it: Even a financial consulting company would fall under such a definition).</description></item></channel></rss>
